# Flow In Soil
 
The coupled Buckingham Darcy's equation for water flow and Fourier's heat equation for heat flow were solved simulatenously to get the water content and temperature evolution.

The required functions are available in [flow_fun.py](https://github.com/kshhhv/Flow-In-Soil/blob/main/flow_fun.py), the main code to solve the equation is in [flow_solving.py](https://github.com/kshhhv/Flow-In-Soil/blob/main/flow_solving.py), finally the simulated data was analyzed by [plotting.py](https://github.com/kshhhv/Flow-In-Soil/blob/main/ploting.py).

The only library used were:
1. Numpy to store arrays
2. Matplotlib to plot
